# Editing the Website

Welcome to your editing portal!
I aim to make this as easy as possible for you!
There are basically just two locations for you to find!

## Main Edit document

To edit almost everything you are going to use this file.
You can find it's location by scrolling up then clicking the file folder

### `src`

Once you've done that click

### `edits.js`

Almost there! At the top of the code you should see a button labled 'Raw'
and to the right of it a pencil.

### `Click on the pencil!`

Do your editing following the instructions in gray!
Once finished Click the green button that says:

### `Commit Changes`

You're done!

## Adding/changing files

To switch out resumes, add or switch photos, or change out polaroid header photos
navigate to the following location

### `src`

### `components`

### `media`

From here simply add a file that is named the exact same thing as the previous file (including the file extention like .jpg)

### Brief descriptions of photos

### Adding Gallery Photos

Just add a new photo in the `Gallery` folder.
Add a second version of the photo with "small" at the end
Make sure the gallery photo is only 300px x 300px resolution

`Use the site https://squoosh.app/ (click resize, uncheck "maintain aspect ratio",
  Change Fit method to contain, then change height and width to 300)`

Then follow the instructions in the edits.js document!

To delete files click the `...` button then click delete button at the bottom!
